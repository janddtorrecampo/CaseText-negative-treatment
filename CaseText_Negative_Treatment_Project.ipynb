This can be seen in the argument presented that the evidence offered by the State, which is similar to the case in  Holland v.

Relying on the case of  Saunders v. Hill,  Husband argues, conversely, that changes in well-settled public policy must be effected by the General Assembly.  202 A.2d at 810 . This reliance is misplaced, however, because the case is factually distinguishable. In  Saunders  the General Assembly had enacted controlling legislation.

Lake, sued his uninsured motorist carrier, The Travelers Indemnity Company (\"Travelers\"), in the Delaware Superior Court as the result of an accident in Quebec, Canada,   between Lake and an unidentified motorist. Quebec law establishes a legal limit on tort recoveries, which is considerably below the limits of Lake's coverage from Travelers. The insurance policy obligates Travelers to pay damages to Lake which he is \"legally entitled to recover\" from an uninsured motorist. The Superior Court ruled that Lake's suit was a contract action, and applied Delaware law. We affirm on different grounds. Thus, the limits of Lake's insurance policy, not the tort limits of Quebec, apply. We overrule  Friday v. Smoot  and adopt the prevailing \"most significant relationship\" test of the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONFLICTS § 145(1). \n",

The negative treatment occurs when the court explicitly states that they are overruling the  Friday v. Smoot  case and adopting a different legal test, specifically the \"most significant relationship\" test from the RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONFLICTS § 145(1). This constitutes negative treatment because it limits and modifies the precedent set by  Friday v. Smoot  without explicitly stating so.
